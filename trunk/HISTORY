  * kill report and sync threads when recv terminate signal
  * add item "store_server" in tracker.conf, by default use the first 
    storage server to store uploaded files

    remove fdfs_define.c
    fdfs_os_bits.h change to _os_bits.h

Version 1.10  2008-09-20
  * performance optimizing: use thread pool, create all work threads at startup
  * trim function op in shared_func.c
  * add Makefile template Makefile.in, delete Makefile and Makefile.freebsd
    change make.sh to support all unix systems (passed in Linux and FreeBSD)

Version 1.9  2008-09-14
  * security enhancement: support allow hosts which can connect to the server
  * server can be run by the specified group and user, set by the config file
  * change make.sh and add file common/fdfs_os_bits.h, 
    remove the warning info of printf format for int64_t param in 64 bits system

  * change some macro name and function name in tracker/tracker_proto.h

Version 1.8  2008-09-07
  * communication protocol changed to support large file exceed 2GB:
     # all integer field is 8 bytes big-endian
     # group name fixed length: FDFS_GROUP_NAME_MAX_LEN bytes
  * storage stat numbers (such as total_upload_count, success_upload_count) 
    use int64_t (8 bytes integer)

  * sockopt.c add function tcpsetnonblockopt
  * shared_func.c add function set_nonblock

Version 1.7  2008-08-31
  * performance optimizing: 
     # change fopen to syscall open
     # increase the efficiency of socket functions tcpsenddata and tcprecvdata
  * change the return value of socket funtions such as tcpsenddata, 
    tcprecvdata and connectserverbyip
      old return value: result=1 for success, result != 1 fail
      new return value: result=0 for success, result != 0 fail, return the error code
  * log function enhancement: 
     # support log level
     # parameter "log_level" added to server config file
     # keep the log file opened to increase performance
  * fix log format and parameter mismatched bug (check by printf)
  * log CRIT message to log file when program exit unexpectedly
  * Makefile add compile flag -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 to support large files
  * change the type of file_size and file_offset to off_t
  * change signal to sigaction
  * fix client Makefile to compile library correctly
  * restart.sh modified: use external command "expr" to replace shell command "let"

Version 1.6  2008-08-24
  * add restart daemon shell script: restart.sh
  * use setrlimit to increase max open files if necessary
  * security enhancement: the format of data filename must be: HH/HH/filename,
    eg. B9/F4/SLI2NAAMRPR9r8.d
  * fix bug: errno is not correct where the downloaded file does not exist,
             communication is broken when the download file is a directory

Version 1.5  2008-08-17
  * add client function storage_download_file_to_file
  * use pthread_attr_setstacksize to increase thread stack size to 1 MB
  * use sendfile syscall to send file in Linux and FreeBSD
  * fix bug: add O_TRUNC flag when open file to write
  * remove warning info compiled by gcc 4.2
  * fcntl set lock.l_len to 0

Version 1.4  2008-08-10
  * storage server recv file method change 
     old method: recv the whole file content/buff before write to file
     new method: write to file once recv a certain bytes file buff, eg. 128KB buff size
  * storage client and storage server send file method change 
     old method: get the whole file content/buff, then send to storage server
     new method: send file to storage server more times. get a certain bytes file buff, then send to storage server
  * upload file package remove the one pad byte field
  * remove storage status FDFS_STORAGE_STATUS_DEACTIVE and add FDFS_STORAGE_STATUS_DELETED

Version 1.3  2008-08-03
  * fix bug: when meta data is empty, get meta data return error
